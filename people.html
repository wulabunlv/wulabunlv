                        <p>She works in the Wu lab as a graduate assistant. Her research interests are mainly in the area of predictive model development, model selection and validation, personalized medicine, and health disparities. She is also interested in using machine learning to improve risk prediction and to enhance our understanding of the disease. Currently, she is focusing on developing statistical models with physical characteristics, clinical history, and genetic information for bone mineral density and osteoporotic fracture prediction. She is also actively involved in population-based epidemiological analyses in understanding the occurrence of disease in a population. </p> 

                        <p>Outside of the lab, she is a doctoral student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Public Health. Before coming to the UNLV, she received my Bachelor of Science in Clinical Laboratory Sciences from Dalian Medical University in 2014. In 2016, she obtained a Master of Science degree in Public Health and Biostatistics from Tulane University. In addition to research work and studies, she enjoys exercising and traveling.</p>

                        <p>She received her Bachelor of Science degree in clinical medicine in 2013, from Henan University of Science and Technology, China. In 2016, and her Master of Science of Public Health degree in Biostatistics at Tulane University. After graduation, she joined the Wu Lab at the Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine as a Biostatistician for six months. In 2017 she started her doctoral work in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UNLV and continuously worked as a Research Graduate Assistant under Dr. Wu's supervision. Her research focuses on the potential contribution of genetic information in personalized medicine and its implications for advances in bone health. She is interested in discovering and translating genetic and etiologic factors that determine the risk of diseases on the individual level, by identifying patterns of genetic variants at loci implicated in disease risk, to increase the ability to measure individual predisposition and to develop personalized approaches for complex traits prediction. </p>

                        <p>Currently, he is working in the Wu Lab as a graduate research assistant at the Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine, where he tries to predict disease outcome (phenotype) using genomic data. He is interested in how mathematics and statistics can be applied to the genomic area, but more specifically his research interests are Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), Machine Learning, Genomic data analysis, and survival analysis. He began to work in Dr. Wu's lab in June of 2019, and he is looking forward to developing new software and methodology related to genomic data.</p>
 
                        <p>Outside of the lab work, he is studying for a Ph.D. program in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree. in Economics and Mathematics and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics at Minnesota State University, Mankato, where he completed his master thesis on "A Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning of Genomic data.‚Äù </p>
 
                        <p>In his free time, he enjoys hiking, playing sports, and spending time with his family and friends.</p>
